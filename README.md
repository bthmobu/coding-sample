# Coding sample

This coding sample visualizes data about (1) ozone pollution monitor readings vs. the distance of the monitor to a [Superfund site](https://www.epa.gov/superfund) and (2) the frequency of natural disasters in Texas. This work was done for Margarita Petrusevich, an economics graduate student at UT Austin. 

It uses data on [Superfund sites](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-data-and-reports), [pollution monitors](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Meta), [annual](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual) and [daily](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Daily) ozone readings, and [FEMA Disaster Declaration Summaries](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/disaster-declarations-summaries-v2).
